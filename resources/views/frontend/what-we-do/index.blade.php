                	<h2>MSW Handling</h2>
                	<p>Municipal solid waste from south Delhi and north Delhi in closed hook loaders or compactors are received at TOWMCL plant at the gate, where they are passed through Radioactive sensors, so that no unwanted waste or Radioactive waste enters the system. the loaders are rejected and concerned facility is informed in case of Radioactive material is detected. The loaders are weighed on an automatic weighing bridge, and they move to an inclined ramp, where they enter Truck Reception Hall.</p>
                	<p>Truck Reception Hall is where all the trucks with MSW are received and MSW is unloaded into the MSW Pit. This hall only has two openings IN and OUT for trucks and the hall is maintained under a negative pressure where air is not allowed to exit the hall. This air is further used in boilers for combustion.</p>
                	<h4>MSW Pits</h4>
                	<p>These are the pits inside the truck reception hall where all the MSW is unloaded and spraying of inoculum and spread of press mud is done while unloading of waste. The Floor of these Pits consists of proper Leachate collection system. MSW in the pits is homogenised time by time and stacked into a heap with the help of grab crane operated by operators in the control room so that leachate by effect of gravity and pressure comes down the waste rests into the pit for next 4 -5 days.</p>

                	<h2>Pre- Processing</h2>
                	<p>MSW travels its journey from being waste to finally be a refused derived fuel Pre- processing system. MSW is transferred to Pre-processing system (PPS) after resting for 4-5 days in the pit with the help of a grab crane. PPS consists of the conveyer belt, Ballistic separator, crusher/ grinder, magnetic separators as equipment. MSW travels on conveyer belts to the ballistic separator and during its path, big stones, wood logs are manually segregated, and the metals are separated by a magnetic separator. Ballistic separators work on the principle of density Separation and if fitted with sieves with different pore sizes which allows the MSW to segregate according to its size, the lighter but bigger fraction comes out as it cannot pass through the sieve is sent to the crusher to get the desired size.</p>
                	<p><strong>The PPS results into 3 main products</strong></p>
                	<ol>
                		<li>Below 10 mm size particle is taken to the compost for further processing.</li>
                		<li>Stone, Glasses which are termed as inert are sent for land filling.</li>
                		<li>Waste that is neither compostable nor inert that lies between 10 mm to 150 mm of size is considered as Refused derived fuel (RDF). RDF is the desired feed for the boilers which will be used for generation of energy.</li>

                        <h3>Waste to Energy</h3>
                        <p class="mb-50">Waste to energy (WtE), is the state-of-the art approach to the treatment of municipal solid waste. In addition to the energy recovery component that gives the process its name, it also includes the effective incineration of the waste, a powerful waste gas purification system, and the recovery of valuable materials from the residual materials. Waste to energy is an effective way to handle the waste by reducing its volume and recover the energy. It is a single approach towards two biggest problem of the world, waste management and depletion of fossils for energy production.</p>

                        <h3>The waste to energy Process</h3>
                        <p class="mb-50">In a modern WTE plant, municipal solid waste is delivered to the site and stored in closed pits preventing the escape any harmful gases. A crane thoroughly mixes and piles up the waste and leachate is collected separately for treatment. The waste after rests for few days, lowers down its moisture content is than passed on to pre-processing system. Waste is finally segregated and the waste meeting the criteria for energy production is termed as RDF (refused derived fuel) which is used as feed to the boiler. The RDF reaches the feed hoppers with the help of cranes, from there it is pushed onto <span class="content-dots">...</span> <span class="content-hide">  the grate by a ram feeder. A fully integrated control system ensures stable and efficient operation and optimises the fire position on the grate. Once combustion is complete, the inert ash that remains falls into the bottom ash extractor, from where it can be taken to a bunker or storage area for metals recovery and further use. The gases released from the waste are mixed with secondary air and recirculated flue gases above the grate. This assures complete combustion and the lowest CO, NOx and VOC emissions. Recirculation of flue gases also increases the plant’s energy efficiency. The energy released is used to produce superheated steam, which is expanded in a turbine generator to generate electricity. Flue gases are then cleaned to the strictest standards and are continuously monitored before being released at the stack.</span> &nbsp;<span class="content-readmore">read more</span></p>

                	<h2>Waste to City Compost</h2>
                	<p>Farmers and gardeners have long understood the benefits of compost to their soil and plants. Application of compost enhances soil’s structure and its ability to hold water. It also creates habitat for beneficial soil organisms, provides a source of slow–release nutrients for plants, and protects plants from soil–borne pathogens.</p>
                	<p><strong>Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:</strong></p>
                	<ol>
                		<li><strong>Carbon </strong>for energy; the microbial oxidation of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested levels. High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.</li>
                		<li><strong>Nitrogen </strong>to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon. High nitrogen materials tend to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.</li>
                		<li><strong>Oxygen </strong>for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.</li>
                		<li><strong>Water </strong> in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.</li>
                	</ol>
                	<p>Certain ratios of these materials will allow microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the compost pile. Active management of the pile (e.g., turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130–160 °F (54–71 °C) until the materials are broken down. The most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon: nitrogen ratio of about 25:1. With the right combination of these ingredients compost is ready to provide nourishment to the soil and helps the plants to grow.</p>
                	<p>Below 10 mm size waste from the ballistic separator is taken to the compost section where it passes through screening process which includes, trommel, destoner and magnetic separator and then piled up into rows for degradation. In between the process, water is sprinkled, and homogenization, aeration of the piles is done and compost is ready in 70 days.</p>
